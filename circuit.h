/**********************************************************************
 this is the abstract base class of circuit
 it has several private attributes
 the most important two is the circuit* comp1 and the circuit* comp2;
 Those two pointers point to the next circuit, the next circuit may be in any type of the derived class, like circuit In single or parallel
 some of the  functions are declared as virtual functions, as i will use polymorphism, the pointer of the base class refering to an object of the derived class will call the coresponding virtual fucntion defined in the coresponding derived class
